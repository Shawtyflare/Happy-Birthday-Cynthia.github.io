        It's your special day, the day that one of the best people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting was born. It's another year having you in other people lives and mine as well. 
        <br>
      
    <br>
        You are a special blessing to me and a lot of people in your life. Especcially JJ. This guy always has something to say about you. I am always looking up to the both of you. If someone would ask me if i believe in love i would always think of the both of you and say that truly there is true love in this world.
        <br>
     
    <br>
For all of that I just wanna say thank you so much. Thank God for putting you on this earth because it would have been much darker without you in it. 
        <br>
          
    <br>
But right now you turn <b>nineteen (Gai, si watu wanazeeka :') </b>, another year with a blessing in our lives, I wish you nothing less than the happiness that you so much deserve, more happiness than is possibly imaginable 💞. I pray that you have many more birthdays 🎂all of which I'll be part of by God's grace 💖.
        <br>

<strong>Alles Gute zum Geburtstag Cynthia und mögest du an diesem Tag eine tolle!💝💝</strong>
